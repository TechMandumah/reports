# Magazine Number Validation Test

## ✅ **Validation Successfully Implemented!**

### **What was added:**

1. **Strict 4-digit validation** for magazine numbers in both PredefinedReportForm and CustomReportForm
2. **Specific error messages** showing exactly which magazine number has issues
3. **Real-time validation** that clears errors when users start typing
4. **Visual feedback** with red borders and error icons

### **Test Cases:**

#### ✅ **Valid inputs (should work):**
- `0001` - Single 4-digit number
- `0001, 0123, 4567` - Multiple 4-digit numbers
- `` (empty) - Allow all magazines

#### ❌ **Invalid inputs (should show specific errors):**
- `1` → Error: "Issue #1: '1' must be exactly 4 digits"
- `12, 123` → Error: "Issue #1: '12' must be exactly 4 digits", "Issue #2: '123' must be exactly 4 digits"
- `abc` → Error: "Issue #1: 'abc' is not a valid number"
- `0001, 12, abc, 4567` → Multiple specific errors for issues #2 and #3

### **User Experience:**
1. User enters invalid magazine numbers
2. Clicks "Generate Report" or "Next Step"
3. Red error box appears with specific issue numbers
4. Input field gets red border
5. User corrects the issues
6. Errors disappear automatically when typing
7. Process continues successfully

### **Error Message Format:**
```
Magazine Number Validation Errors:
• Issue #1: "12" must be exactly 4 digits (e.g., 0001, 0123, 4567)
• Issue #2: "abc" is not a valid number
```

This ensures users know exactly which magazine number needs to be fixed and what the correct format should be.
